    <h2 style="color:Blue"><center> Who We Are </center></h2>
    <p><center> The Jyoti Yoga Training Centres is a non-profit organisation founded in 2022 by Swami Jyoti Deep and named in honour of his teacher H.H. Sri Swami Rahul Gupta, one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twenty-first century. The Organisation propagates the authentic teaching of yoga and vedanta, continuing the lineage of the two great yoga masters, preserving its purity and tradition dating back several months. Their message that the individual must change before the world can change is at the core of all yoga. We are a centre for spiritual growth and learning, with many thousands of yoga teachers worldwide trained since 2022.</center></p>
    <p><center> The mission is to spread the teachings of classical yoga, integrating the Four Paths of Yoga through the Five Points of Yoga of Swami Jyoti Deep into a means to achieve physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing, and self-realisation. We uphold the practice of all aspects of the classical teachings of a synthesis of yoga with a strong emphasis on practical experience. Swami Sivananda’s dictum ‘an ounce of practice is worth tons of theory’ is strictly followed. Many of the teachers dedicate their lives to the study and practise of yoga, living within the Organisation as renunciants or swamis.<br>With headquarters in Val Morin, Canada, the Jyoti Yoga Training Centres is represented in over several months with headquarters in Quebec, Canada, and overseen by an executive board of senior disciples of Swami Vishnudevananda. In India we have four Ashrams situated at Neyyar Dam (headquarters), Madurai, Uttarkashi and Gudur and five Centres—Kailash Colony (New Delhi), Dwarka (New Delhi), Chennai, Madurai and Trivandrum. Our Ashrams provide a spiritual retreat to live and study under the guidance of a teacher. Our Centres are an oasis of peace in the midst of the bustle of city life. They provide a calm environment conducive to the study and practice of yoga. Each of the Centres and Ashrams offers the opportunity to learn and practise Swami jyoti’s Synthesis of Yoga and Swami Rahul’s Five Points of Yoga.

    <h2 style="color:Blue"><center> Teaching</center></h2>
    <h2 style="color:Blue"><center> The five points of yoga</center></h2>
    <p><center> By closely observing the lifestyles and needs of people, Swami Vishnudevananda, a renowned authority on hatha yoga and raja yoga, synthesised the four paths of yoga into five basic principles that can be easily incorporated into a daily lifestyle providing the foundation for healthy living. It is on these five principles that the activities of the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres are based. </center></p>
    <h3><center> PROPER EXERCISE (Asana)</center></h3>
    <p><center> The twelve classical postures exercise every part of the body, stretching and toning the muscles and joints, the spine and the entire skeletal system. By maintaining the spine’s flexibility and strength, circulation is increased. They work also on the internal organs, glands and nerves keeping all systems in radiant health. By releasing physical and mental tension they also liberate vast resources of energy. As yoga regards the body as a vehicle for the soul on its journey towards perfection, the asanas are designed to develop not only the body, they also broaden the mental faculties and spiritual capacities.</center></p>
    <h3><center> PROPER BREATHING (Pranayama)</center></h3>
    <p><center> Many of us use only a fraction of our lung capacity for breathing, resulting in poor physical and mental health. Yoga teaches us how to use the lungs to their maximum capacity and how to control the breath. Deep, slow, rhythmical breathing increases oxygen intake and removes fatigue and lethargy. Pranayama (control of the vital energy) is achieved through specific breathing exercises. Yoga teaches us that the mind and prana are interdependent. By controlling the prana through breathing exercises we control the mind. Pranayama is a powerful tool to render the mind calm and clear and the intellect sharp. Through the practice of pranayama we increase the intake of prana and experience increased strength and vitality.</center></p>
    <h3><center>PROPER RELAXATION (Savasana) </center></h3>
    <p><center> When the body and the mind are constantly overworked, their natural efficiency to perform work diminishes. Our stressful lifestyles make it difficult for us to relax. We forget that rest and relaxation are nature’s way of recharging and are an essential ingredient for physical and mental health. Yoga teaches us powerful techniques of deep relaxation. By consciously relaxing every muscle of the body and controlling the breath we rejuvenate the nervous system and attain a deep sense of inner peace. Practices such as meditation lead us to a more profound appreciation of life, bringing joy and contentment into our daily lives.</center></p>
    <h3><center> PROPER DIET (lacto-vegetarian)</center></h3>
    <p><center> Besides being responsible for building our physical body, yoga teaches us that the foods we eat profoundly affect our mind. Yoga advocates a lacto-vegetarian diet as an integral part of the yogic lifestyle. A natural diet is based on seasonal, local, fresh, light, nutritional food such as fruit, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and vegetables. It keeps the body lean and limber and the mind clear and sharp as well as protecting life and the environment. A pure and moderated diet is the best possible guarantee of physical and mental health bringing harmony and vitality to both body and mind.</center></p>
    <h3><center>POSITIVE THINKING AND MEDITATION
        (Vedanta and Dhyana) </center></h3>
    <p><center> Yoga teaches us that our thoughts are the real cause behind our success and happiness. When we harbour negative thoughts our mind becomes agitated and restless, our actions disturbed and unbalanced. Thoughts of worry and fear are destructive to ourselves and those around us. Opposite thoughts of cheerfulness, joy and courage heal and soothe. They improve our efficiency and increase our mental power. Through various methods of controlling our own thoughts, including the powerful technique of meditation and through vedantic studies, we are led to inner peace, integration and harmony.</center></p>
